# EEG

`main branch`: params, model components, final model, and xai

`amulya branch`: preprocessing of eeg signals

`sahil branch`: preprocessing of eeg spectrograms

`will branch`: ekg experimentation

### To-do (post the 42687 course): 
* streamline training by using torch lightning and reducing boilerplate code
* incorporate best software engineering practices and convert all code into executable scripts
* demo notebook for end-to-end pipeline
* comprehensive readme for reproducibility
* future work section from final paper/report
