# EEG Dataset exploration and feature engineering

The following python notebooks were created for the following purposes:
1. EEG_FeatureEngineering.ipynb - Implementation of the various feature engineering techniques: DWT, MAV, MAP, VAR, STD, ENTROPY, VARIANCE THRESHOLDING
2. EEG_Signal_DataLoader_FeaturesExp.ipynb - Experimentations with various features based on datasets
3. eeg-signal-dataloadercode.ipynb - Data loader code to combine both EEG signal data, spectrograms, and target_values to form dictionary
